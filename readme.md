# This is a dataset for keypoint detection
## More importantly, it's actually a generator of image and keypoint label

You can get following advanteges:<br>
(1) infinite training images generated on the fly<br>
(2) customize image height and width<br>

You can use it to:<br>
(1) achieve a pre-trained model and then do transfer-learning<br>
(2) check out the ability of some model on severe occlusion<br>

(1) puppet.py main doc<br>
(2) puppet_test.ipynb notebook for example<br>
(3) eval.py evaluate mAP using OKS <br>
